- Interpret and communicate the impact of macroeconomic scenarios on credit risk.

### 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will provide a concise overview of the relevant mathematical and statistical concepts.

**2.1 Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD):**

- **Definition:**  $PD$ is the probability that a borrower will default on their debt obligations within a specified time horizon. $LGD$ is the percentage of loss expected if a default occurs.
- **Real-world Application:**  $PD$ and $LGD$ are crucial inputs for credit risk management, regulatory capital calculations, and loan pricing.
- **Formula:** Expected Loss (EL) can be defined as $EL = PD * LGD * EAD$, where EAD is Exposure at Default.

**2.2 Stationarity:**

- **Definition:** A time series is stationary if its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) do not change over time.
- **Real-world Application:** Many time series models require stationarity for accurate forecasting.
- **Testing:** Stationarity can be verified using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron tests.

**2.3 Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model:**

- **Definition:** An ARDL model is a regression model that includes lagged values of both the dependent variable and independent variables.

- **Formula:** The general form of an ARDL(p, q, r) model is:

$$y_t = \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \beta_j x_{1,t-j} + \sum_{k=1}^{r} \gamma_k x_{2,t-k} + \epsilon_t$$

Where:
    - $y_t$ is the dependent variable at time $t$.
    - $x_{1,t}$ and $x_{2,t}$ are independent variables at time $t$.
    - $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the lag orders for the dependent and independent variables, respectively.
    - $\phi_i$, $\beta_j$, and $\gamma_k$ are coefficients.
    - $\epsilon_t$ is the error term.
- **Real-world Application:** ARDL models are useful for capturing both the persistence of the dependent variable and the lagged effects of independent variables.  An example, as mentioned in the prompt, could be:

$$ \text{DefaultRate}_t = \alpha + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i \text{DefaultRate}_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \beta_j \text{Unemployment}_{t-j} + \sum_{k=1}^{r} \gamma_k \text{GDPGrowth}_{t-k} + \epsilon_t$$

**2.4 Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model:**

- **Definition:** A VAR model is a multivariate time series model that captures the interdependencies between multiple variables.
- **Formula:**
For a two-variable VAR(p) model:
$$y_t = c + A_1 y_{t-1} + A_2 y_{t-2} + \dots + A_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t$$
where $y_t = \begin{bmatrix} y_{1t} \\ y_{2t} \end{bmatrix}$ is a vector of two time series variables, $c$ is a constant vector, $A_i$ are coefficient matrices, and $\epsilon_t$ is a vector of error terms.
- **Real-world Application:** VAR models are useful for jointly modeling multiple related time series, such as default rates, GDP growth, and unemployment.

**2.5 ARIMAX Model:**

- **Definition:**  An ARIMAX model extends the ARIMA model by including exogenous variables.
- **Formula:** The ARIMAX model can be expressed as:
$(1 - \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i L^i)(1-L)^d y_t = (1 + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \theta_i L^i) (\sum_{j=1}^{k} \beta_j x_{jt} + \epsilon_t)$
Where:
$y_t$ is the time series being forecasted.
$x_{jt}$ are the exogenous variables.
$L$ is the lag operator.
$p, d, q$ are the orders of the autoregressive, integrated, and moving average parts of the model.
$\phi_i, \theta_i, \beta_j$ are the model coefficients.
$\epsilon_t$ is the error term.
- **Real-world Application:** ARIMAX models are useful when the time series is influenced by external factors, allowing for more accurate forecasting.

**2.6 Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):**

- **Definition:** VIF quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in a multiple regression model. It measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if your predictors are correlated.
- **Formula:** $VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}$ , where $R_i^2$ is the R-squared value from regressing the $i$-th predictor on all other predictors in the model.
- **Real-world Application:** High VIF values (typically > 5) indicate strong multicollinearity, which can lead to unstable and unreliable regression coefficients.
